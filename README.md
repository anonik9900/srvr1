# WHAT IS JAILBREAK ?

iOS jailbreaking is privilege escalation for the process of removing software restrictions imposed by Apple on iOS and tvOS. It does this by using a series of kernel patches. Jailbreaking permits root access to iOS, allowing the downloading and installation of additional applications, extensions, and themes that are unavailable through the official Apple App Store.

iOS jailbreaking dates back to the original iPhone in July 2007 and has continued into the present day. Apple has responded with updates to iOS: patching exploits and upgrading hardware. Jailbreaking communities have not been legally threatened. The legal status of jailbreaking is unclear in most countries; while many prohibit tampering with digital locks, they tolerate jailbreaks that do not infringe on copyrights. In 2010, 2012, and 2015, the U.S. Copyright Office approved exemptions allowing smartphone users to jailbreak their devices.

Jailbreaking in general means breaking the device out of its "jail",a metaphor used in Unix-style systems, for example in "FreeBSD jail". A jailbroken iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad running iOS can still use the App Store, iTunes, and other normal functions, such as making telephone calls. Furthermore, a jailbroken device can be reverted to a standard 'jailed' device by restoring the device in Recovery Mode, although any incompatible software installed while jailbroken will be wiped.

Jailbreaking is a form of privilege escalation, and describes privilege escalation on devices by other manufacturers as well.


# Motivations
One of the reasons for jailbreaking is to expand the feature set limited by Apple and its App Store. Apple checks apps for compliance with its iOS Developer Program License Agreement before accepting them for distribution in the App Store. However, their reasons for banning apps are not limited to safety and security and may be regarded as arbitrary and capricious. In one case, Apple mistakenly banned an app by a Pulitzer-Winning cartoonist because it violated its developer license agreement, which specifically bans apps that "contain content that ridicules public figures." To access banned apps, users rely on jailbreaking to circumvent Apple's censorship of content and features. Jailbreaking permits the downloading of programs not approved by Apple, such as user interface customization and tweaks.


# When a device is booting, it loads Apple's own kernel initially.

The device must then be exploited and have the kernel patched each time it is turned on.

An "untethered" jailbreak has the property that if the user turns the device off and back on, the device will start up completely, and the kernel will be patched without the help of a computer â€“ thus enabling the user to boot without the need to use a computer.These jailbreaks are harder to make and take a lot of reverse engineering and years of experience.

With a "tethered" jailbreak, a computer is needed to turn the device on each time it is rebooted. If the device starts back up on its own, it will no longer have a patched kernel, and it may get stuck in a partially started state. By using a computer, the phone is essentially "re-jailbroken" (using the "boot tethered" feature of a jailbreaking tool) each time it is turned on. With a tethered jailbreak, the user can still restart SpringBoard ("respring") on the device without needing to reboot.

There is also "semi-tethered" solution, which means that when the device boots, it will no longer have a patched kernel (so it will not be able to run modified code), but it will still be usable for normal functions such as making phone calls, or texting. To use any features that require running modified code, the user must start the device with the help of the jailbreaking tool in order for it to start with a patched kernel (jailbroken).

In July 2016, Pangu team introduced the "semi-untethered" jailbreak, which functions like a semi-tethered solution in that when the device boots, it no longer has a patched kernel (and thus access to jailbroken functions,) but also like an untethered device, in that a computer is not required to re-patch the kernel in order to re-enable the jailbreak. It is accomplished by installing an app that re-patches the kernel after rebooting.


The first iPhone worm, iKee, appeared in early November 2009, created by a 21-year-old Australian student in the town of Wollongong. He told Australian media that he created the worm to raise awareness of security issues: jailbreaking allows users to install an SSH service, which those users can leave in the default insecure state.In the same month, F-Secure reported on a new malicious worm compromising bank transactions from jailbroken phones in the Netherlands, similarly affecting devices where the owner had installed SSH without changing the default password. In 2010 blogger John Gruber, who is close to Apple, said that users misunderstood some jailbreak exploits and that they were more serious than they appear. He commented that "it's odd how the press is mostly covering this as 'jailbreaking now more convenient' rather than 'remote code exploit now in the wild'", pointing out that the exploit allowed the creator of a malicious website to take control of iPhones accessing it.

Restoring a device with iTunes can remove a jailbreak.

In 2012, Forbes staff analyzed a UCSB study on 1407 free programs available from Apple and a third party source. Of the 1,407 free apps investigated, 825 were downloaded from Apple's App Store using the website App Tracker, and 526 from BigBoss (Cydia's default repository). 21% of official apps tested leaked device ID and 4% leaked location. Unofficial apps leaked 4% and 0.2% respectively. 0.2% of apps from Cydia leaked photos and browsing history, while the App Store leaked none. Unauthorized apps tended to respect privacy better than official ones. Also, a program available in Cydia called PrivaCy allows user to control the upload of usage statistics to remote servers.

Installing software published outside the App Store has the potential to affect battery life and system stability if the software is poorly optimized or frequently uses resource-draining services (such as 3G or Wi-Fi).However, even apps from the App Store are known to cause battery issues while running in the background.

In August 2015 the KeyRaider malware was discovered that affects only jailbroken iPhones.
